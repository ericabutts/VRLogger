# VRLogger
This tool creates a text file with a list of GameObjects clicked in Oculus VR.

The VR Action Logger script creates a raycast and checks every game object you click in the Oculus.

A file is also created, and can be found once the headset is restarted in the Windows File Explorer. Check under PC > Oculus Quest > Android > data > com.oculus.UnityProjectName. The generated file will be saved there.

Put the VR Action Logger script onto the OVR Player Controller.
